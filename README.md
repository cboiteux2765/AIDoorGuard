# AIDoorGuard

SB Hacks XII Project, a proactive hardware sensing system to check if you brought all your items to go somewhere before you leave. Uses Arduino Motion Sensor which sends a BT HC05 signal and FastAPI web server listens to COM port connections to prompt audio I/O on browser and LLM gives items to bring.
